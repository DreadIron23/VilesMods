# Vile's Mods
 A repository for all of Vile's Rimworld mods and patches.
 
 I've started a Patreon! Check it out, and support me if you wish! http://patreon.com/vileheathen. 
 
 The above link also functions as a blog where I will post updates and progress of current and upcoming mods, as well as guides, data, flowcharts and fun stuff like that.

Thank you for all the great support and feedback, and to all the talented modders in the HSK team and beyond. This wouldn't be possible without all of you!

A quick rundown of what we got so far, followed up change log:


**Wood You Please** Overhauls trees and wood. Each tree species gives a unique type of wood with unique stats and color, adding variety and complexity, kind of like animal leathers.

**Hardcore Renovation** This is formerly "Vile's Wall sand Floors HD". Adds tons of and retextures walls, floors, fences, and doors. Utilizes the new wood system.

**Amuse Bouche** A meals overhaul. No more generalized "fine meals" etc. Adds tons of recipes with origins from around the world and streamlines the food hediff system.

**Vile's Metallurgy** Overhauls production of pre-industrial matierals - mainly steel, increasing complexity and realism. Adds new alloys, production buildings, weapons, tools, and more.

**Vile's Pre-Industrial** This is available as an optional mod in Hardcore SK and is required for Metallurgy. Retextures, rebalances, and adds content - mainly armor and black powder weapons - ranging from neolithic up until industrial tech.

Update September 20, 2021 - Updated for 1.3

These Rimworld mods are meant to work with Hardcore SK. They're currently built for Rimworld 1.3, so you'll need the dev branch here, if you're not already playing it: https://github.com/skyarkhangel/Hardcore-SK/tree/development

Adding these mods is unlikely to break your savegames, though weird things might happen and you'll be missing out on some content, so I recommend starting a new save file.
Note that Hardcore Renovations requires both my brand new mod "Wood You Please", as well as "Fences and Floors". The latter is not my mod, but I'm including a patched version that's needed.
