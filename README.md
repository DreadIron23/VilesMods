# Vile's Mods
 A repository for all of Vile's Rimworld mods and patches.
 
 I've started a Patreon! Check it out, and support me if you wish! http://patreon.com/vileheathen. 
 
 The above link also functions as a blog where I will post updates and progress of current and upcoming mods, as well as guides, data, flowcharts and fun stuff like that.

Thank you for all the great support and feedback, and to all the talented modders in the HSK team and beyond. This wouldn't be possible without all of you!

Update September 20, 2021 - Updated for 1.3

These Rimworld mods are meant to work with Hardcore SK. They're currently built for Rimworld 1.3, so you'll need the dev branch here, if you're not already playing it: https://github.com/skyarkhangel/Hardcore-SK/tree/development

Adding these mods is unlikely to break your savegames, though weird things might happen and you'll be missing out on some content, so I recommend starting a new save file.
Note that Hardcore Renovations requires both "Wood You Please" and "Fences and Floors". The latter is not my mod, but I'm including a patched version that's needed.
